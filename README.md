## Model Architecture

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for traffic congestion prediction. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting and sequential data analysis. It's particularly effective for capturing long-term dependencies in time series data, making it ideal for predicting traffic patterns that may have both short-term and long-term influences.

## Results

The LSTM model demonstrates high prediction accuracy, significantly improving the efficiency of traffic management and urban planning processes.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with other types of recurrent neural networks or attention mechanisms
- Incorporate additional data sources for more comprehensive analysis
- Optimize model performance for real-time predictions
- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the system
